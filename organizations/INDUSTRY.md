====Startups====
* [AliveCor](https://www.alivecor.com/) - Creates device and software that will turn any smartphone into a clinical-quality electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder with analytics and tracking. Khosla ventures backed startup.
* [Athelas](http://athelas.com/) - device for blood analysis using deep learning. Athelas has created a machine that looks at a drop of blood and identifies how many white blood cells it has, said Tandon.
* [Bay Labs](https://baylabs.io/) - cardiovascular disease diagnosis [using ultrasound](https://medium.com/@dcvc/deep-learning-for-image-analysis-dcvc-backs-bay-labs-ai-powered-ultrasound-a6a04dbafa03)
* [Corti.ai](http://www.corti.ai/) - NLP based startup to analyze phone conversations to find dangerous symptoms and assist medical personnel to make critical decisions in case of heart attack and other life critical cases.
* [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) - building a biologically accurate data- and AI-driven platform that supports geneticists, molecular biologists and chemists in the development of therapies. Will use its platform to unlock new classes of antisense oligonucleotide therapies that were previously inaccessible or out of reach, and advance them for clinical evaluation. In project Saturn, the platform will be used to search across a vast space of over 69 billion molecules with the goal of generating a library of 1000 compounds that can be used to manipulate cell biology and design therapies. Khosla ventures backed startup.
* [Dentem](https://www.dentem.co/) - dental practice management tool + ML for image analysis.
* [Dr. AI by HealthTap](https://medium.com/@HealthTap/dr-a-i-80b4cf06be30) - a personal Artificial Intelligence-powered “physician” that helps route users to doctor-recommended insights and care immediately.

* [Genetesis](http://genetesis.com/) - using deep learning, sensors, and physics to diagnose chest pain. The company has created a test based on a biomagnetic imaging system that monitors the weak magnetic fields that naturally emanate from the chest. It generates a 3D map of the heart that can tell a doctor whether you are having a heart attack or not.
* [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io) - Ginger.io offers emotional support coaching, therapy, and psychiatry. It is behavior analytics company and spinoff of the MIT Media Lab. The company uses big data from mobile phones to model user behavior and make inferences about health and wellness. Khosla ventures backed startup.
* [Heartvista](http://www.heartvista.com/) - creating new MRI platform for the radiologists and cardiologists. Using ML to assist the user in collecting and analyszing data.
* [Lumiata](https://lumiata.com/) - applies big data-driven medical science to patient data in order to optimize every health care interaction and eliminate paperwork. Integrating disparate sources of data in a variety of formats, including claims, labs, EHRs and more, to create a more accurate and enriched longitudinal member record.

====Corporations====
* [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/about-deepmind-health/) - apply ML and mostly deep learning to wide range of diagnostics - head and neck scans at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, eye scans at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, mammograms with the Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre) and de-personalised medical records with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Also introduced mobile app called "Streams". "Streams" is a secure mobile phone app that aims to address what clinicians call “failure to rescue” – when the right nurse or doctor doesn’t get to the right patient in time. Each year, many thousands of people in UK hospitals die preventably from conditions like sepsis and acute kidney injury, because the warning signs aren't picked up and acted on in time.
