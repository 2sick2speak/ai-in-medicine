__Intel & MobileODT Cervical Cancer Screening__

In this competition, you will develop algorithms to correctly classify cervix types based on cervical images. These different types of cervix in our data set are all considered normal (not cancerous), but since the transformation zones aren't always visible, some of the patients require further testing while some don't. This decision is very important for the healthcare provider and critical for the patient. Identifying the transformation zones is not an easy task for the healthcare providers, therefore, an algorithm-aided decision will significantly improve the quality and efficiency of cervical cancer screening for these patients.

__Second Annual Data Science Bowl__

In this dataset, you are given hundreds of cardiac MRI images in DICOM format. These are 2D cine images that contain approximately 30 images across the cardiac cycle. Each slice is acquired on a separate breath hold. This is important since the registration from slice to slice is expected to be imperfect.

The competition task is to create an automated method capable of determining the left ventricle volume at two points in time: after systole, when the heart is contracted and the ventricles are at their minimum volume, and after diastole, when the heart is at its largest volume.

__Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection__

Recorded from the human scalp, EEG signals are evoked by brain activity. The relationship between brain activity and EEG signals is complex and poorly understood outside of specific laboratory tests. Providing affordable, low-risk, non-invasive BCI devices is dependent on further advancements in interpreting EEG signals. 

This competition challenges you to identify when a hand is grasping, lifting, and replacing an object using EEG data that was taken from healthy subjects as they performed these activities. Better understanding the relationship between EEG signals and hand movements is critical to developing a BCI device that would give patients with neurological disabilities the ability to move through the world with greater autonomy.

__American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge__

Seizure forecasting systems have the potential to help patients with epilepsy lead more normal lives. In order for EEG-based seizure forecasting systems to work effectively, computational algorithms must reliably identify periods of increased probability of seizure occurrence. If these seizure-permissive brain states can be identified, devices designed to warn patients of impeding seizures would be possible. Patients could avoid potentially dangerous activities like driving or swimming, and medications could be administered only when needed to prevent impending seizures, reducing overall side effects.

Intracranial EEG was recorded from dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy using an ambulatory monitoring system. EEG was sampled from 16 electrodes at 400 Hz, and recorded voltages were referenced to the group average. These are long duration recordings, spanning multiple months up to a year and recording up to a hundred seizures in some dogs.

Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data clips are organized in folders containing training and testing data for each human or canine subject. The training data is organized into ten minute EEG clips labeled "Preictal" for pre-seizure data segments, or "Interictal" for non-seizure data segments.

__UPenn and Mayo Clinic's Seizure Detection Challenge__

Of the more than two million Americans who suffer from recurrent, spontaneous epileptic seizures, 500,000 continue to experience seizures despite multiple attempts to control the seizures with medication. For these patients responsive neurostimulation represents a possible therapy capable of aborting seizures before they affect a patient's normal activities. 

Intracranial EEG was recorded from dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy using an ambulatory monitoring system. EEG was sampled from 16 electrodes at 400 Hz, and recorded voltages were referenced to the group average.

Data are organized in folders containing training and testing data for each human or canine subject. The training data is organized into 1-second EEG clips labeled "Ictal" for seizure data segments, or "Interictal" for non-seizure data segments.

__DecMeg2014 - Decoding the Human Brain__

The goal of this competition is to predict the category of a visual stimulus presented to a subject from the concurrent brain activity. The brain activity is captured with an MEG device which records 306 timeseries at 1KHz of the magnetic field associated with the brain currents. The categories of the visual stimulus for this competition are two: face and scrambled face. A stimulus and the concurrent MEG recording is called trial and thousands of randomized trials were recorded from multiple subjects. The trials of some of the subjects, i.e. the train set, are provided to create prediction models. The remaining trials, i.e. the test set, belong to different subjects and they will be used to score the prediction models. Because of the variability across subjects in brain anatomy and in the patterns of brain activity, a certain degree of difference is expected between the data of different subjects and thus between the train set and the test set.

__MLSP 2014 Schizophrenia Classification Challenge__

Schizophrenia is a severe and disabling mental illnesses which has no well-established, non-invasive diagnosis biomarker. Currently, due to its symptom overlap with other mental illnesses (like bipolar disorder) it can only be diagnosed subjectively, by process of elimination.

This competition invites you to automatically diagnose subjects with schizophrenia based on multimodal features derived from their brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

__CONNECTOMICS__

Understanding the brain structure and some of its disease alterations is key to research on the treatment of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other neuropathologies, as well as understanding the general function of the brain and its learning capabilities. The brain contains nearly 100 billion neurons with an average 7000 synaptic connections.  Recovering the exact wiring of the brain (connectome) at this neural level is therefore a daunting task. Traditional neuroanatomic methods of axonal tracing cannot scale up to very large networks.

Validation and test data include time series of activities of neurons "extracted" from simulated calcium fluorescence imaging data. The neurons are arranged on a flat surface simulating a neural culture and you get the coordinates of each neuron. The model takes into account light scattering effects.

__Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression with Smartphone Data__

There are many symptoms and features of Parkinson’s disease which can be objectively measured and monitored using simple technology devices we carry every day. Mobile phones are some of the most pervasive forms of monitoring devices, with many smartphones carrying basic sensors that can be used to give a window into a patient’s life. We have taken the initial steps with such a device, developing a basic collection application, and collecting data from a group of Parkinson’s patients and control subjects.

Now the challenge is on you to determine the best way to use it!

The challenge is to develop a way to help patients and clinicians using objective, passively collected data points. The goal is to use the provided data to distinguish PD patients from control subjects and/or to quantify PD symptoms in a way that could enable the measurement of disease progression.

__Predict HIV Progression__

This contest requires competitors to predict the likelihood that an HIV patient's infection will become less severe, given a small dataset and limited clinical information.

These sequences are from patients who had only recently contracted HIV-1 and had not been treated before.

The Dataset is organized as follows:
Col-1: patient ID
Col-2: responder status ("1" for patients who improved and "0" otherwise)
Col-3: Protease nucleotide sequence (if available)
Col-4: Reverse Transciptase nucleotide sequence (if available)
Col-5: viral load at the beginning of therapy (log-10 units)
Col-6: CD4 count at the beginning of therapy

The Responder status indicates whether the patient improved after 16 weeks of therapy.  Improvement is defined as a 100-fold decrease in the HIV-1 viral load.

__Breast Histology Bioimaging Challenge 2015__

This Challenge is presented in the context of breast cancer and has the goal of pushing forward the methods for automatic classification of tissue malignancy in the field of digital pathology. Tumor classification requires careful examination of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained biopsy samples performed by pathologists. Given an image of an HE stain biopsy tissue sample (examples below), the goal is to automatically classify the sample as: a) normal tissue; b) benign lesion; c) carcinoma in situ; or d) invasive carcinoma. A dataset with 140 high-resolution (2048x1536), annotated HE stain images has been produced specifically for this Challenge.
